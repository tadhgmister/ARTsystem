# tower pi

This folder contains the programs and modules intended to be run on the tower pi:
- control the servo motor to turn the camera to face the vehicle.
- control the camera to take photos of car and save them on file system
- process the images taken by camera to identify the LED locations and calculate the position and orientation of the car
- database operations to log the positions calculated (incomplete)
- communication with vehicle to accept requests and respond with UDP messages.

The files here were developed seperately and compiling them into this folder has resulted in a bit of a mess. sorry for that.

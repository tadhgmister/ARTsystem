SYSC3010 Fall 2019, Group W6

This code is responsible for communicating with the Arduino on the vehicle in
our system.  The serial port path should be set up manually to avoid sending
data to the wrong serial port.

Version 1.1: Updated running loop and set default serial port path to ttyUSB0
Version 1.2: Moved code into a function for use by other scripts.
Version 1.3: Updated function to take a list of values as a single argument
    instead of a variable number of args.  Also added a 2 second sleep to allow
    the Arduino to sync properly.
